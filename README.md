## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- IFTTT Account and API Key
- 2Captcha Account and API Key
- Linux (Debian or Kali) environment
- Internet connection

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y wget curl imagemagick unzip apache2 jq build-essential gcc g++ make git libssl-dev zlib1g-dev linux-libc-dev python3 python3-pip firefox
```

### 2. Replace Placeholder Values

- Replace `YOUR_IFTTT_API_KEY` with your actual IFTTT API key.
- Replace `YOUR_CAPTCHA_API_KEY` with your actual 2Captcha API key.
- Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SITE_KEY` and `YOUR_PAGE_URL` with the appropriate values for CAPTCHA solving.
- Replace `YOUR_VENICE_AI_API_KEY_HERE` with your Venice AI API key.

### 3. Run the Script

Make the script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x exploit_script.sh
./exploit_script.sh <TARGET_PHONE_NUMBER>
```

## Usage

The script can be run with different AI integrations using command-line options:

- `-P` for Poe AI
- `-V` for Venice AI
- `-E` for Exa AI

Example:

```bash
./exploit_script.sh -P <TARGET_PHONE_NUMBER>
```

## Features

### 1. CAPTCHA Solving

The script uses 2Captcha to solve CAPTCHAs and store cookies for subsequent API calls.

### 2. SMS Sending

The script uses IFTTT Webhooks to send SMS with the encoded exploit image.

### 3. Web Server Setup

Sets up a web server with a simple GUI for controlling the exploit.

### 4. AI Integration

Uses Venice, Poe, and Exa AI for various tasks such as information gathering, network scanning, and web application security testing.

### 5. VSCode and Plugin Installation

Installs VSCode and plugins for Venice, Poe, and Exa AI.

## AI Integration

The script integrates with Venice, Poe, and Exa AI to perform various cybersecurity tasks. It uses the respective AI's API to generate models and responses based on the provided prompts.

### Venice AI

- **Information Gathering**: Generates a model for gathering information about the target system.
- **Network Scanning**: Generates a model for scanning the network for vulnerabilities.
- **Web Application Security**: Generates a model for testing web application security.

### Poe AI

- **Information Gathering**: Generates a model for gathering information about the target system.
- **Network Scanning**: Generates a model for scanning the network for vulnerabilities.
- **Web Application Security**: Generates a model for testing web application security.

### Exa AI

- **Information Gathering**: Generates a model for gathering information about the target system.
- **Network Scanning**: Generates a model for scanning the network for vulnerabilities.
- **Web Application Security**: Generates a model for testing web application security.

## Commands

The script includes several commands that can be run from the search bar in the bottom panel in Kali Linux:

- `view-ai-db`: Shows all data in the AI shared database and asks the user to choose between either an MHTML file or a native window.
- `view-ai-input`: Displays all user prompts in the shared database in a native window for all three AIs.
- `view-ai-output`: Displays all AI output in the shared database in a native window for all three AIs.
- `view-poe-output`: Displays all Poe AI output in the shared database in a native window for Poe AI.
- `view-venice-output`: Displays all Venice AI output in the shared database in a native window for Venice AI.
- `view-exa-output`: Displays all Exa AI output in the shared database in a native window for Exa AI.
- `view-poe-input`: Displays all Poe AI user prompt input in the shared database in a native window for Poe AI.
- `view-venice-input`: Displays all Venice AI user prompt input in the shared database in a native window for Venice AI.
- `view-exa-input`: Displays all Exa AI user prompt input in the shared database in a native window for Exa AI.

## Web Server Setup

The script sets up a web server with a simple GUI for controlling the exploit. The web server is configured to run on Apache2 and includes a form for submitting the target phone number.

### Accessing the Web Server

After running the script, you can access the web server by navigating to `http://localhost` in your web browser.

### Web Server GUI

The web server GUI includes a form for submitting the target phone number and a button to run the exploit.

## VSCode and Plugin Installation

The script installs Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and the necessary plugins for Venice, Poe, and Exa AI.

### Installing VSCode

The script automatically installs VSCode based on the operating system (Linux or macOS).

### Installing Plugins

The script installs the following plugins for VSCode:

- Venice AI Plugin
- Poe AI Plugin
- Exa AI Plugin

## Notes

- This script is for educational purposes only and should be used in a controlled environment.
- Always test scripts in a safe environment before deploying them on production systems.
- The script is designed to run on both Debian and Kali Linux systems.
- Ensure you have the necessary API keys and account credentials before running the script.
